I am G. Sai Harshith of Electrical Engineering\[EE22BTECH11022\]. For
the Lamda project, I tried to make a quiz app, displaying questions and
options. once you click the next button it shows the next question, if
you choose any option if it is correct it gives green output otherwise
it gives red output. But unfortunately, because of less time, I
couldn\'t able to complete the total work. I was doing my lab project
till the 12th in IIT. So I started this work on the 12th, I successfully
learned HTML+CSS and made a quiz app open page pattern. I thought to use
only the frontend(javascript) or otherwise switch to the backend(Django)
for moving ahead, so I choose the backend from there. Now still i am
learning Django. But I will try to make my total quiz app before my
interview and successfully show it to you. Sorry for not completing it.
But I gave my complete efforts to learn them. Thank you.
